'''
You’ve learned about dictionaries, strings and how you can manipulate strings by joining them using different methods. However, there are other useful
aspects of string manipulation such as extracting the relevant data out of a string. Write a program (in Python 3) to print “I have attended ------ sessions!!”
from the below variable dataset containing sessionIDs
'''
#[hint : it’s a good idea to use the split function]

#Eg. Sessions_Attended = {'sessions' : '1011,2344,'}
#Answer:
#I have attended 2 sessions!!

Sessions_Attended = {'sessions' : '1011,2344,3222,44322,555,6332,721,8789,99,1011,1124,1245,137,1499'}
#split the value of "sessions" by , into an array
num_sessions = Sessions_Attended["sessions"].split(",")
#show the length of the array and convert it to string to printout the total of sessions attended
print("I have attended " + str(len(num_sessions)) + " sessions!!")
